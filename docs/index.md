#Overview


##What is LogBot?
LogBot is an activity logging bot for Discord built in Python with the [Disco](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco) library. It has support for multiple logs per server and changing what events each channel log.



##What all can LogBot do?
LogBot can only log various server events to the specified channels in that server, this allows for the moderators and administrators to have great configurability over what the bot logs in the server and what it doesn't, it can even have each log as a different style if you want. The bot doesn't even need to log everything.



##Where can I get my own LogBot?
You can either host the bot yourself by cloning/downloading the code found on the [GitHub Page](https://www.github.com/Alkali-Metal/DiscordLogBot) or you can invite the hosted one to your server by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=360581683705020421&scope=bot), make sure that if you are wanting to use the `fancy` log type, the bot *needs* to have the `Embed Links` permission, otherwise it will fallback to the `fanceh` styling.



##How do I host my own LogBot?
I'm not going to really be supporting locally hosted bot's, so I would recommend you just using the one that is hosted for you, but if you absolutely do not want to use the one I am hosting, you can figure out how to run it by messing around with it and gettting it to work or asking a community member to help you.
